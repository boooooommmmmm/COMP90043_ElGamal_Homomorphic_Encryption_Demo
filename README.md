## What is this project?

This is a simple demo project for COMP90043 Cryptography and security report "**Cryptography for privacy preserving data aggregation**". For more information about this subject, please click [here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90043).

This project is to demonstrate how ElGamal Homomorphic Encryption works and the limited of this encryption function.

## How can I run it?

1. The executable files are [ElGamal.java](COMP90043_Demo_ElGamal_Homomorphic_Encryption/src/Demo/ElGamal.java) and [ElGamal_iteration_test.java](COMP90043_Demo_ElGamal_Homomorphic_Encryption/src/Demo/ElGamal_iteration_test.java)
2. For Beta version, you are only allowed to input two **Integer** as plaintext.
3. Each input can not be larger than 2^31 -1 (the input size depends on the int size for java and how key generate).
4. The final result for [ElGamal.java](COMP90043_Demo_ElGamal_Homomorphic_Encryption/src/Demo/ElGamal.java) will like this:

5. The final result for [ElGamal_iteration_test.java ](COMP90043_Demo_ElGamal_Homomorphic_Encryption/src/Demo/ElGamal_iteration_test.java)will like this:
